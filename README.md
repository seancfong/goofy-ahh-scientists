# Montreal Crime Analysis
[Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/montreal-crime-analysis-62zasd)
## Our Project

As a group we chose to analyze the Montreal Crime data and make policy recommendations based off what we observed.
We also created a web page that has a work in progress dashboard to present overall crime numbers for each precinct

## Methodology

Our first step was to immediately begin creating a viable search function for the data set allowing us to pull up necessary information. We have two primary search functions that supported our analysis. 

## Raw Analysis

Top Three Crimes: 
Theft from/to a motor vehicle
Breaking and entering, 
Mischief
Murder Count: 230
Police Precincts with the most crimes:
Precinct 38 (17496)
Precinct 21 (14549)
Precinct 20 (13805)
Police Precinct with least number of crimes (Omitting Special Precincts)
Precinct 11 (Kirkland)

## Cross Referencing with Zip Codes

A mainstay of discussions about crime rates and safety is the overall economic stability and prosperity of an area. Taking this into account, we took the top three precincts and their neighborhoods and cross referenced that with their zip codes recorded median household income.
Precinct 38: $59,000 
Precinct 21 and 20: $58,000
Both precincts are under the median income for a household in montreal which is $63,000
Further Precinct 38 has the highest number of youth residents in Montreal and Precinct 21 and 20 encompass all of Downtown Montreal. 
On the other side is Precinct 11, with a median income of $110,000

## Policy Changes

Increased investment in low-income areas
Focus on break in/theft related crimes as murder rates while significant are not as high
Youth adolescent outreach programs
Focus on gentrification impacts
